## ✉️ A Note from the Developers

This repository is **not an official release** of NautilusOS.  
It began as a direct copy of our open-source project and was later renamed.  
While forks are allowed under the AGPL-3.0 license, the license **requires** clear attribution, a dated notice of modifications, and continued openness of the source code.

If you’d like to explore or contribute to the genuine NautilusOS, visit the official repository above.  
We encourage respectful experimentation and learning—keep it **open, honest, and properly credited.**  
That’s how open source thrives.
